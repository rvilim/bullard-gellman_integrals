bullard-gellman_integrals
=========================

This project efficiently evaluates Adams Gaunt and Elsasser integrals which are usefull in Geomagnetic calculations. These are of the form

Adams-Gaunt: http://bit.ly/1wiAxzX

Elsasser: http://bit.ly/1vU1T0o

Where each Y is a spherical harmonic, and each can have a complex conjugate. This software requires a fortran compiler and FFTW to use. Warning, use this software at your own risk
